# Intro

This document shows how **individual bottle** bacterial abundance data
from NAAMES remineralization bioassays were processed, QCâ€™d, and
analyzed.

\#Save Data

only look at data that is relevant to MS, including treatments with
parallel/bottle comparisons

``` r
ba <- ba.df %>% 
  filter(Treatment %in% c("Control", "TW5", "TW10", "TW20"), Depth == 10, !Station == "U") 

saveRDS(ba, "~/GITHUB/naames_bioav_ms/Input/Bact_Abund_Input.rds")
```
